					So, our project idea arises from the need of simplistic methods to create, modify, mix music for the developers of tune or just to have fun with music, even if one does not know how to actual instruments. We are making a transparent platform which can recognise different colours and play music accordingly. The position of the block on the platform will decide the pitch and tempo of the music. We can even play different music audios at the same time, based on the recognition of different colours. our project design is inspired by the "Rubberbeats", Department of Computer and Information Science
					Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. Basically, we are performing changes in the audio clip based on the movement of an object facilitated by hand.

					We can various altercation of the same idea, which we are going to work upon. during project development.
					It can have varied uses :
					a)In the music industry, and,
					b)also common people usually having a hobby of playing with music beats can have a great time using it.
					c)For specially-abled students who face a hard time learning conventional instruments, are more comfortable with patterns, colors and music can use this device to learn and create new music. The recognition abilities of these students can be enhanced through its use.
